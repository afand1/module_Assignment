    "### Code Walkthrough:\n",
    "1. **Base Case (`if len(arr) <= 1:`):**\n",
    "   - For an array with 1 or 0 elements, the function simply returns the array. This is an **O(1)** operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pivot Selection (`pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]`):**\n",
    "   - Selecting the pivot takes **O(1)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partitioning the Array:**\n",
    "   - The list comprehensions `[x for x in arr if x < pivot]`, `[x for x in arr if x == pivot]`, and `[x for x in arr if x > pivot]` each involve iterating through the entire array of size \\(n\\).\n",
    "   - Together, partitioning the array takes **O(n)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursive Calls (`quicksort(left)` and `quicksort(right)`):**\n",
    "   - Assuming the pivot divides the array into two parts of approximately equal size, the recursion splits the array into two subproblems of size \\(n/2\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrence Relation:\n",
    "The recurrence relation for this algorithm can be written as:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)\n",

    "- \\(2T(n/2)\\): Recursive calls for the two halves,\n",
    "- \\(O(n)\\): Time for partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Recurrence:\n",
    "Using the **Master Theorem**:\n",
    "- \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(f(n) = O(n)\\),\n",
    "- Compare \\(n^{\\log_b a} = n^{\\log_2 2} = n^1\\) with \\(f(n) = O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\(f(n)\\) matches \\(n^{\\log_b a}\\), the overall time complexity is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(n) = O(n \\log n)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worst Case:\n",
    "In the worst case, the pivot divides the array into sizes \\(1\\) and \\(n-1\\) (highly unbalanced). The recurrence becomes:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)\n",
